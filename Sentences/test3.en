Doctor treats 10 patients a day
He acts as chairman
She acts as a guide
Tom acts silly
The police acted on information
She is acting on the advice
Sri Lanka acts according to those standards
The advertisement changed the desire of the people

She changes her name
I saw his violent act against animals
